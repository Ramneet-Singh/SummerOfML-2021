  Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are two of the most studied areas of Deep Learning. Computer Vision is used in various fields like Medical imaging, automatic driving and so on. Similarly, NLP is used in chatbots, recommendations, world understanding and so on. This talk will take you a bit deeper into what makes the computer understand images or text - CNNs and RNNs. Get to know more about these building blocks how they have been crucial to Machine Learning over the years and we hope you will be using them in your own projects soon enough.
