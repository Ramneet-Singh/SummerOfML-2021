  info: "<u>Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics</u><br><b>Pramit Das</b><br><i>1st Year PhD, University of Michigan</i><br><br><i>Abstract:</i> <p>We plan to learn the fundamental uses of Eigenvalues, matrix factorization, and how we use those notions in ML. 
In the second part, we intend to go over some basic statistical distributions and a very simple yet useful technique called Naive Bayes Classification.
