  Pramit is a 1st Year PhD student at the University of Michigan. He achieved AIR 1 in GATE 2020 in Statistics. He is an ISI Calcutta graduate and an INMO Awardee.
  </p><br><h3>Abstract</h3><p>
  We plan to learn the fundamental uses of Eigenvalues, matrix factorization, and how we use those notions in ML. 
In the second part, we intend to go over some basic statistical distributions and a very simple yet useful technique called Naive Bayes Classification.

  topic: Introduction to Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Nets
  description: "<h3>Speaker Bio</h3><p>
  Jay will graduate this year from the Computer Science Dept IIT Delhi. He has been associated with ML right from his first year and has experience working on problems with industries like Bosch and Microsoft. He will now be joining Microsoft as an ML engineer. He is currently working with Prof Chetan Arora in collaboration with AIIMS.
  </p><br><h3>Abstract</h3><p>
  Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are two of the most studied areas of Deep Learning. Computer Vision is used in various fields like Medical imaging, automatic driving and so on. Similarly, NLP is used in chatbots, recommendations, world understanding and so on. This talk will take you a bit deeper into what makes the computer understand images or text - CNNs and RNNs. Get to know more about these building blocks how they have been crucial to Machine Learning over the years and we hope you will be using them in your own projects soon enough.
