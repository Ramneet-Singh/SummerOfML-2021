  Pramit is a 1st Year PhD student at the University of Michigan. He achieved AIR 1 in GATE 2020 in Statistics. He is an ISI Calcutta graduate and an INMO Awardee.
  </p><br><h3>Abstract</h3><p>
  We plan to learn the fundamental uses of Eigenvalues, matrix factorization, and how we use those notions in ML. 
In the second part, we intend to go over some basic statistical distributions and a very simple yet useful technique called Naive Bayes Classification.
